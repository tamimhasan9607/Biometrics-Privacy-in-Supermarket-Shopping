The study utilizes both quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews to investigate patterns in the acceptance of biometric technology. It sheds light on significant privacy concerns and evaluates the impact of convenience factors and demographic variables. This study highlights the urgent requirement for improved data security, public education campaigns, and inclusive strategies in the integration of biometric technology. The results of this study are anticipated to provide valuable guidance for policymakers and retailers. These insights will be essential for the responsible and ethical implementation of biometric technologies in supermarket shopping. In this context, it is crucial to strike a delicate balance between technological progress and protecting individual rights.
